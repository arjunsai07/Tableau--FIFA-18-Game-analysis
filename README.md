# FIFA 18 Data Visualization- A tableau dashboard project built to understand the key insights from the FIFA 18 game dataset.

## Project Overview

This project aims to visualize the comprehensive data of players available in FIFA 18 using Tableau. Through interactive dashboards, we explore various aspects of the data, including player ratings, potential, club distributions, nationality, and more. The goal is to uncover insights into player performances, club strategies, and overall trends within the game.

## Features

- **Player Performance Analysis**: Detailed visualizations of player ratings across different clubs and countries.
- **Potential Talent Identification**: Insights into young talents with high potential in the game.
- **Club and Country Comparisons**: Comparative analysis of clubs and countries based on player statistics.
- **Positional Analysis**: Breakdown of player abilities across different playing positions.

## Data Source

The dataset consists of detailed attributes for every player included in FIFA 18. Attributes include but are not limited to:

- Overall rating
- Potential
- Club
- Nationality
- Skills ratings

Data was sourced from [Kaggle's FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset).
