# FIFA 18 Data Visualization- A tableau dashboard project built to understand the key insights from the FIFA 18 game dataset.

## Project Overview

This project aims to visualize the comprehensive data of players available in FIFA 18 using Tableau. Through interactive dashboards, we explore various aspects of the data, including player ratings, potential, club distributions, nationality, and more. The goal is to uncover insights into player performances, club strategies, and overall trends within the game.

## Data Source

The dataset consists of detailed attributes for every player included in FIFA 18. Attributes include but are not limited to:

- Overall rating
- Potential
- Club
- Nationality
- Skills ratings

Data was sourced from [Kaggle's FIFA 18 Complete Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset)

### Visualizations

- Clubs with most number of top players
- Median ages of players in top 5 clubs
- Defending/Attacking capacity of top 5 clubs
- Distribution of players by country
- Most valuable player

## Story from the visuals     

•	The current analysis is focused on clubs participating in European leagues. 40 clubs with ~18K players are analysed. 
•	Players from 163 countries are playing in one of the clubs. England, Spain, Germany, Argentina, and France contribute to roughly 1/3rd of the total number of players, as apparent from the visual. This seems obvious owing to the immense popularity of the sport in these countries. 
•	Gestalt’s Similarity principle is followed here since in the first visual, the size of the uniform circular bubbles illustrates the magnitude of population from each country.
•	The visual '**Clubs with most number of top players**' speaks about the top clubs in the world, where soccer’s experts play in (Reputation>=4 points). The chart says about the most sought-after players in soccer. As soccer enthusiasts may agree, the top slots (Reputation=5) are filled by famous sportsmen Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Lionel Messi. 
•	As seen in the visual '**Median ages of players in top 5 clubs**', median age of players across top 5 clubs (Reputation>=4) is above the median age of players in general (25 years). We can infer from this that players spend a few years in international circuit before they gain experience and reach the pinnacle. Paris Saint Germain and FC Barcelona seem to have the highest median age.
•	In the visual '**Defending/Attacking capacity of top 5 clubs**, it is visible that the average defensive capacity and shooting capacity of various teams is 49.4 and 53.5 respectively.
•	But on seeing the top 5 clubs in the visual, it is clear that most of these teams have the defensive and shooting capacity well above the average values.
•	We can understand that the top teams have a superior shooting capacity compared to their defence.
•	**Most valuable player**-Cristiano Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the legends of the game. He is one of the highest paid player, as we can see from the visual.
•	Moreover, his shooting capacity is 93, which is the highest among all the players part of this analysis.
•	There is an amazing balance across all his attributes such as Shooting, Dribbling and Defence.
